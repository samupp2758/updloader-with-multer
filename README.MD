# Uploader With Multer

## What is it
This project was created to share files between me and my co-worker while we were working on a video. With that we needed speed and consequently needed a fast file sharing.

So I created a nodejs/express/multer server that would provide a html page where my co-worker would upload his files to the server (was running on my machine), and I would get the files and go on with the video editing.

## Improvements
Add a download file tree where my coworker would be able to get the files that I want him to download.
